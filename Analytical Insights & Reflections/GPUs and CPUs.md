### 4. Programming Models for GPUs

#### GPU Programming with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
- **Developed by NVIDIA:** CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA for general computing on GPUs.
- **CUDA Language:** Extends C/C++ with parallel computing capabilities.

**Basic CUDA Concepts:**
- **Kernel:** A function executed on the GPU.

- **Blocks:** Groups of threads.
- **Grids:** Arrays of blocks.

**Example CUDA Program:**
```cpp
// CUDA kernel function to add two vectors
__global__ void add(int *a, int *b, int *c) {
    int index = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
}

int main() {
    int *a, *b, *c;                // host copies of a, b, c
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;          // device copies of a, b, c
    int size = N * sizeof(int);    // size of the vectors

    // Allocate space for device copies of a, b, c
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, size);

    // Copy inputs to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch add() kernel on GPU with N threads
    add<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c);

    // Copy result back to host
    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Cleanup
    cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);
    return 0;
}
```

    int index = get_global_id(0);
    c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
}

    // Create a context and command queue
    context = clCreateContext(NULL, 1, &device, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    queue = clCreateCommandQueue(context, device, 0, NULL);

    // Create and build the program
    const char *programSource = 
        "__kernel void add(__global int *a, __global int *b, __global int *c) {"
        "  int index = get_global_id(0);"
        "  c[index] = a[index] + b[index];"
        "}";
    program = clCreateProgramWithSource(context, 1, &programSource, NULL, NULL);
    clBuildProgram(program, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    // Create the kernel
    kernel = clCreateKernel(program, "add", NULL);

    // Create memory buffers
    cl_mem d_a = clCreateBuffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, N * sizeof(int), NULL, NULL);
    cl_mem d_b = clCreateBuffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, N * sizeof(int), NULL, NULL);
    cl_mem d_c = clCreateBuffer(context, CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY, N * sizeof(int), NULL, NULL);

    // Copy the lists to their respective memory buffers
    clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, d_a, CL_TRUE, 0, N * sizeof(int), a, 0, NULL, NULL);
    clEnqueueWriteBuffer(queue, d_b, CL_TRUE, 0, N * sizeof(int), b, 0, NULL, NULL);

    // Set the arguments to the kernel
    clSetKernelArg(kernel, 0, sizeof(cl_mem), &d_a);
    clSetKernelArg(kernel, 1, sizeof(cl_mem), &d_b);
    clSetKernelArg(kernel, 2, sizeof(cl_mem), &d_c);

    // Execute the kernel
    size_t globalSize = N;
    clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(queue, kernel, 1, NULL, &globalSize, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);

    // Read the result buffer back to the host
    clEnqueueReadBuffer(queue, d_c, CL_TRUE, 0, N * sizeof(int), c, 0, NULL, NULL);

    // Cleanup
    clReleaseMemObject(d_a);
    clReleaseMemObject(d_b);
    clReleaseMemObject(d_c);
    clReleaseKernel(kernel);
    clReleaseProgram(program);
    clReleaseCommandQueue(queue);
    clReleaseContext(context);
    return 0;
}
